## Startup Blueprint Creator Agent

What if you could go from amorphous startup idea to a complete business blueprint within minutes?  
This project is about making that vision a reality using Generative AI + IBM Cloud.  
This is no longer just a tool - it is your co-founder on Day 0.


## About this Project 
- This project was developed during my **IBM SkillsBuild Virtual Internship** in partnership with the **Edunet Foundation**.
- The objective was to **build an intelligent agent**, leveraging **IBM Watsonx.ai** that will guide aspiring founders through the disorderly early stages of building a startup. 
- The agent will generate everything related to the startup's genesis in natural language, just like the founder's adviser's would as they validate ideas, conduct target user analysis, plan a funding strategy and develop their MVP planning tool 


## Why It Matters
It is hard to start up. The average person will give up before they even write a plan.

This project has demonstrated how **GenAI can process complex thinking simply** to help individuals, students, and innovators:
- Validate their ideas
- Get to know their intended audience
- Plan realistically
- Act faster
Where everything is done in the same place.


## What the Agent Does
--> Understand your startup idea  
--> Ask intelligent follow-up questions to help refine the plan  
--> Generate an entire startup blueprint with the following:  
- Idea Validation
- Your Target User Persona
- Funding Strategy
- MVP Planning  
--> Output results in structured format (JSON)  
--> Designed to be extendable with external tools (e.g., web crawlers, search, Wikipedia)
